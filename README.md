## Idioten

This Matlab project simulates a number of games of the 1-player card game "idioten" and reports the statistical probability of winning.

A saved deck is found in "deck_used.mat" for experimenting and debugging. To get deterministic behaviour, use this deck instead of randomly generating a new one in the beginning of main.

## Example of usage

An example output from running the simulation such that 100 wins are reached:

\>> main(100)

Total amount of games played: 3383

Average amount of games per win: 33.83

Win percentage: 2.956 %
