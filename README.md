# Idioten

This Matlab project simulates a number of games of the 1-player card game "idioten" and reports the statistics of winning.

An example output from running the simulation such that 100 wins are reached.
>> main(100)
Total amount of games played: 3383
Average amount of games per win: 33.83
Win percentage: 2.956 %

A saved deck is found in "deck_used.mat" for experimenting and debugging. To get deterministic behaviour, use this deck instead of randomly generating a new one in the beginning of main.
